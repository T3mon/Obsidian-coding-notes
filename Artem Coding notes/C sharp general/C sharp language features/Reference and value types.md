Reference types are objects that are stored on the heap, and a reference to them is stored on the stack. When you create a reference type, you're actually creating an object on the heap, and the variable that you assign to it is just a reference to that object.

Value types, on the other hand, are stored on the stack, and the value of the type is stored directly in the variable. When you create a value type, a new instance of that type is created on the stack, and the value is stored directly in that instance.
Here's a table comparing the differences between reference types and value types in C#:
##### DIfferences

| **Aspect**              | **Reference Types**                                            | **Value Types**                                                         |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Memory Allocation**   | Allocated on the heap                                          | Allocated on the stack or inline within other objects                   |
| **Type Category**       | Classes, interfaces, arrays, delegates                         | Structs, enums, primitive types (int, float, etc.)                      |
| **Default Value**       | `null` (no reference)                                          | Default value of the type (e.g., 0 for `int`, false for `bool`)         |
| **Assignment**          | Copies the reference (pointer)                                 | Copies the actual value                                                 |
| **Storage Location**    | Store the reference to the data                                | Store the actual data                                                   |
| **Lifetime Management** | Managed by the garbage collector                               | Lifetime is determined by the scope in which they are declared          |
| **Boxing/Unboxing**     | Boxing and unboxing operations are required for value types    | Not applicable                                                          |
| **Parameter Passing**   | Passed by reference by default                                 | Passed by value by default                                              |
| **Memory Overhead**     | Additional overhead due to reference management                | Typically less overhead but may increase with struct size               |
| **Equality Comparison** | By default, compares references (unless overridden)            | Compares actual values                                                  |
| **Immutability**        | Immutable reference types can be created, but not by default   | Value types are immutable by nature, but can be mutable                 |
| **Inheritance**         | Supports inheritance and polymorphism                          | Does not support inheritance; structs cannot inherit from other structs |
| **Nullability**         | Can be null                                                    | Cannot be null (unless using nullable types, e.g., `int?`)              |
| **Performance**         | Generally slower due to heap allocation and garbage collection | Generally faster due to stack allocation and no garbage collection      |
| **Usage Scenario**      | Used for objects representing entities with identity           | Used for small data structures or when high performance is needed       |
##### Question/answer
1. What is the difference between a value type and a reference type?
Value types are stored on the stack, and their value is stored directly in the variable. Reference types are stored on the heap, and the variable contains a reference to the object.
2. Can you change the value of a reference type variable?
Yes, you can by assigning a new object to it.
3. Can you change the value of a value type variable?
Yes, you can by assigning a new value to it.
4. How do you determine if a type is a value type or a reference type?
- Reflection
- typeof(T).IsValueType
-  looking at its declaration
1. What happens when you pass a value type to a method?
When you pass a value type to a method, a copy of the value is made, and the method operates on the copy.
6. What happens when you pass a reference type to a method?
When you pass a reference type to a method, a reference to the same object is passed. The method can modify the object, but it cannot change the reference itself.
7. How do you create a value type instance?
You can create a value type instance using the `new` keyword, or by using a literal syntax.
8. How do you create a reference type instance?
You can create a reference type instance using the `new` keyword, and calling a constructor.
9. What is a boxing conversion?
A boxing conversion is the process of converting a value type to a reference type.
10. What is an unboxing conversion?
An unboxing conversion is the process of converting a reference type back to a value type.
