Certainly! LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a powerful feature in C# that allows you to query and manipulate data from various sources. Here are some popular LINQ interview questions and their answers:

1. Q: What is LINQ?
A: LINQ is a set of features in C# that adds native data querying capabilities to .NET languages. It provides a consistent query experience for objects (LINQ to Objects), relational databases (LINQ to SQL), XML (LINQ to XML), and more.
2. Q: What are the two main forms of LINQ syntax?
A: 
   - Query Syntax: Uses SQL-like syntax (from, where, select)
   - Method Syntax: Uses extension methods (Where, Select, OrderBy)
3. Q: Give an example of LINQ query syntax vs method syntax.
A: 
   Query Syntax:
   ```csharp
   var query = from num in numbers
               where num % 2 == 0
               select num;
   ```
   Method Syntax:
   ```csharp
   var query = numbers.Where(num => num % 2 == 0);
   ```
4. Q: What is deferred execution in LINQ?
A: Deferred execution means that the evaluation of a LINQ query is delayed until the moment when the query variable is actually iterated over. This allows for more efficient processing of data.
5. Q: How can you force immediate execution of a LINQ query?
A: You can use methods like ToList(), ToArray(), or ToDictionary(), or operators like Count() or First().
6. Q: What is the difference between First() and FirstOrDefault()?
A: First() throws an exception if no element is found, while FirstOrDefault() returns the default value of the type (null for reference types, 0 for value types) if no element is found.
7. Q: Explain the purpose of the 'let' keyword in LINQ.
A: The 'let' keyword is used to introduce a new range variable to store intermediate results in a query expression.
8. Q: What is the difference between Select and SelectMany?
A: Select projects each element of a sequence into a new form. SelectMany flattens a sequence of sequences into a single sequence.
9. Q: How does GroupBy work in LINQ?
A: GroupBy organizes a sequence of elements into groups based on a specified key selector function.
10. Q: What is the purpose of the Join operation in LINQ?
A: Join correlates elements of two sequences based on matching keys.
11. Q: Can you explain lazy loading in the context of LINQ?
A: Lazy loading is related to deferred execution. It means that data is not retrieved until it's actually needed, which can improve performance.
12. Q: What's the difference between IEnumerable and IQueryable?
A: IEnumerable is used for in-memory collections, while IQueryable is used for remote data sources like databases. IQueryable allows the query to be optimized at the data source level.
## More complex example demonstrating some LINQ concepts:
```csharp
var result = from p in products
             join c in categories on p.CategoryId equals c.Id
             where p.UnitPrice > 20
             orderby p.ProductName
             select new { 
                 ProductName = p.ProductName, 
                 Category = c.CategoryName, 
                 Price = p.UnitPrice 
             };

var list = result.ToList(); // Forces execution
```
This query joins products and categories, filters products by price, orders them, and projects into a new anonymous type. The ToList() call at the end forces immediate execution of the query.
