1. Inheritance:
   - Abstract class: A class can inherit from only one abstract class.
   - Interface: A class can implement multiple interfaces.
2. Method implementation:
   - Abstract class: Can contain both abstract and implemented methods.
   - Interface: Prior to C# 8.0, couldn't contain method implementations. Since C# 8.0, can have default implementations.
3. Fields and properties:
   - Abstract class: Can contain fields and properties with implementation.
   - Interface: Cannot contain fields, only properties without implementation (prior to C# 8.0).
4. Constructors:
   - Abstract class: Can have constructors.
   - Interface: Cannot have constructors.
5. Access modifiers:
   - Abstract class: Can use various access modifiers.
   - Interface: All members are implicitly public.
6. Static members:
   - Abstract class: Can contain static members.
   - Interface: Cannot contain static members (prior to C# 8.0).
7. Purpose:
   - Abstract class: Used to define common behavior for a group of related objects.
   - Interface: Used to ==define a contract that unrelated classes can implement==.
8. Extensibility:
   - Abstract class: Harder to extend as a class already inherits from it.
   - Interface: Easier to extend by adding new methods without breaking existing code.
9. Performance:
   - Abstract class: Can be slightly faster due to direct method calls.
   - Interface: May be slightly slower due to virtual method table lookup.
10. Evolution:
    - Abstract class: More challenging to change without breaking existing code.
    - Interface: Easier to evolve, especially with the introduction of default methods in C# 8.0.

The choice between an abstract class and an interface depends on your project's specific requirements. Abstract classes are better when you want to provide a base implementation for a group of related classes, while interfaces are ideal when you need to define common behavior for unrelated classes or when you need multiple implementation.
