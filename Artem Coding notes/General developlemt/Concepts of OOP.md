- **Encapsulation**: Bundling the data (variables) and code (methods) together as a single unit known as a class. **Access modification**.

- **Inheritance**: Creating new classes that **reuse, extend, and modify the behavior** defined in other classes. ![[Pasted image 20240627151717.png]] 
- **Polymorphism**: Using a unified interface to call different underlying forms of methods. ![[Pasted image 20240627150104.png]] *Function overloading as an example of dynamic/runtime polymorphism*
- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem.
