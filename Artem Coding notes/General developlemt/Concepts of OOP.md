- **Encapsulation**: Bundling the data (variables) and code (methods) together as a single unit known as a class. **Access modification**.


- **Inheritance**: Creating new classes that are based on existing classes. 
- **Polymorphism**: Using a unified interface to call different underlying forms of methods. 
- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem.
